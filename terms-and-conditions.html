          <li>
            <span class="font-bold">Electrical Outlets:</span>
            It is the homeowners responsibility to ensure there is at least 1 working outlet on the front of the house
            and, unless they are buying an extension cord from Tis the Season, that they've left us an extension cord of
            sufficient length that it will reach the outlet from their roofline.
          </li>

          <li>
            If the outlet on the front of the home does not work and we are required to trouble shoot the electrical to
            get it working we will add a minimum of $50 to the invoiced value of the project.
          </li>

          <li>
            If we cannot figure out why there is not power to the outlet easily, we will move to our next installation
            so as not to delay our schedule. If we leave without being able to power up your lights, it is then your
            responsibilty to get the electrical outlet working and notify us when it is. Once the outlet is working we
            will return to your project when we are next in your area.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-bold">Homes With Soffit Outlets:</span>
            If your home has soffit outlets and you want us to use them and install a timer, the timer must be a
            <a class="text-blue-600 underline" href="https://www.amazon.com/Century-Photocell-Resistant-Photoelectric-Weatherproof/dp/B01MAWA81Q"

            timer.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you leave a dial timer for us to install, we will not install it.  If you then purchase a photocell timer
            and request we return to install it, we reserve the right to charge a $50 trip fee to do so.
          </li>

          <li>
            Damage caused to bulbs or lines becoming unclipped from flags, trees, or other such circumstances that are
            out of our control. If you request a fix and we arrive at your home and determine the fix was necessary due
            to a flag or tree limb, we will invoice you a minimum of $75 to cover our trip time and time to correct the
            issue. A flag blown in the wind will knock out bulbs and unclip lights from gutter and rooflines. Tree
            branches which encroach on the roofline of your home will do the same.
          </li>
          <li>
            We generally remove flags if we can when we install your lights. We recommend you leave your flag down for
            the duration that your lights are on your home.
          </li>
          <li>
            We do not assume responsibility to trim your trees back away from your roofline. We recommend you to have
            tree limbs and branches trimmed away from your home before we arrive to install your lighting. This way they
            do not interfere with your lights. If you request a fix for bulbs out or line unclipped due to trees near
            your home, we will invoice you for a minimum of $75 to cover our trip time and the time required to fix the
            issue. >

            request we do so. We assume no liability and you agree we are released from any liability if replacing a
            bulb causes any issue or short in your electrical system. We will not provide the bulbs for replacement, we
            assume that you will have them ready for us when we are there to install your holiday lights. We will not
            make a separate trip to install soffit lights only. Cost for replacing soffit lights is $50 for a normal
            house. If your house is larger than normal, we will provide a cost to replace soffit bulbs on-site.

            We limit our scope of available services to providing and installing holiday lighting only. We assume that

          <li>
            <span class="font-bold">Invoicing and Payment: </span>We will only install your lighting if your invoice is
            paid in full. We notify you via text message a minimum of twice in advance of your scheduled install date.
            If your invoice is not paid on the day of your scheduled install, we will skip your install and your
            lighting installation will be delayed until we are in your area again.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-bold">Text Message Communication: </span>The most efficient way for us to communicate with
            all our customers about scheduled installations is via text message. We ask you provide us with permission
            to send you text messages and with a valid cell phone number. If you decline to allow us to communicate with
            you via text message and you'd like updates, it is your responsibility to call our office and request an
            update. We promise never to provide your information to another party or to use your phone number for
            anything other than communication related to your holiday lighting.

        <ul class="mt-10 text-3xl font text-gray-600 font-hairline leading-relaxed space-y-4">
          <li>
            <span class="font-bold">Claims that we "lost" timers or extension cords:</span>
            When we remove your lighting from your home in January, the lights, extension cord, and timers go into a rubbermaid
            tote and that goes directly into storage.  We do not remove anything from the tote until we re-install your lights the
            next year.  It is therefore nearly impossible for us to "lose" any of your equipment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Oftentimes when customers accuse us of "losing" an extension cord or timer, they actually removed the corder/timer
            before we took down the lights or if they store their own lights they've removed some of the equipment from the
            tote during the year.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you believe we've lost an extension cord or timer, please call us and discuss.  We'll ask that you provide
            some sort of evidence that you did not remove the items before we took your lights down.  It is not our responsibility
            to keep track of what is on your light string when we remove your lights.
          </li>
          <li>
            Our recommendation is that you leave all your equipment (extension cord, timer, etc...) attached to your Lights
            all season and until we take down your lights.  That way we know we'll have everything we need to get your
            lights back up the next season.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-bold">Taking a year off or no longer live in the same home:</span>
            If you decide not to have your lights hung in a given year, it is your responsibility to communicate with us
            via email or text what you would like us to do with your lights.  If you choose not to work with us and we have
            no communication from you about your lights, we reserve the right to recycle your lights for scrap to optimize
            our storage spaces.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you are taking a year off and want us to hang on to your lights, you must communicate that via text/email
            and we'll save your lights for you.  If we have no communication we reserve the right to recycle your lights
            for scrap.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you've moved homes and indicate that you no longer want your lights, that you want to leave your lights for
            the new homeowner, or you don't communicate at all, we take this as an immediate surrender of the ownership of
            your lights and we reserve the right to recycle them for scrap.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-bold">Items Stored:</span>
            We are only responsible for storing items that fit in your rubbermaid totes.  This includes lights, extension cords,
            and timers.
          </li>
          <li>
            At this time we do not have storage available for wreaths or other items.  During takedown we will leave anything
            that does not go in your tote on your front porch and you are responsible for its storage.

            We've installed hundreds of thousands of feet of lighting in the 5 years we've been in business and our installation

            we will notify you about it and correct at cost to us.

            If you believe we damaged something on your home and we did not notify you about it, we ask that you communicate with
            us about it.  We'll request that you provide evidence that the damaged item WAS NOT damaged prior to our installing
            or removing your lights and if you can provide that evidence we will cover the cost to repair whatever was
            damaged.
